This mod aims to provide extensive compatibility between Supplementaries and the total conversion mod TerraFirmaCraft (TFC).

Their respective repositories can be found at:
https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries
https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft


There are various small adjustments made for compatibility, including, but not limited to:
- Changed recipes for most items to fit what can be obtained in TFC
- Added burnout for candle holders, fire pits, and sconces. The burnout time can be set by config
- Goblets can hold TFC fluids, up to 100mb (equivalent to 1 drink from a TFC bottle)
- Pancakes store their expiration date, even when placed. All 8 pancakes you can store in a pancake block have their individual dates saved
- Presents are huge and very heavy, like sealed large vessels / sealed barrels / anvils. This allows using them as actual presents, while preventing abusing presents for non-overburdening storage
- Added small TFC mobs to the list of cage-able mobs

Limitations of Supplementaries and TFC mean that not everything works 1:1 as it does in Supplementaries, so here are the major changes that go beyond simple compatibility:
- Sacks use the TFC overburdening system instead of the Supplementaries overencumberance system. Furthermore, they are fixed to 9 slots, but can hold large items (unlike large vessels)
- Planters are not permanently hydrated, instead making fertilizer more efficient (multiplier can be set by config)
- Sconce levers do not invert their redstone signal if they go out, since they have automatic burnout (but it can be reenabled by config)

Some features have not been made compatible for the time being:
- Flax (mostly replaced by TFC jute fiber)
- Netherite doors and trapdoors
- Raked gravel
- Stone / Blackstone / Deepslate / End Stone lamps
- Flower box (although enabling simple mode in the Supplementaries config should allow planting TFC flowers in them)
- Safes
- Lumisene


Keep in mind:
This is not final, as more features will be added to, and completed from, the to-do list over time!
