Potential future TODO:
a. Possible compat for Amendments (split off from Supplementaries) & Supplementaries Squared (Addon)
b. Soap in-world behaviour
c. Retexturing various blocks to fit TFC color palettes
d. Flower box accepting TFC large flowers (only accepts regular large flowers)
e. Gunpowder trail working with TFC gunpowder bowls & powderkegs

Observed TFC bugs
- TFC candles get broken by pistons, TFC colored candles do not
- TFC candles lastUpdateTick doesn't get reset when put out manually, leading to a "time remaining" Jade tooltip
