Potential future TODO:
- Possible compat for Amendments (split off from Supplementaries) & Supplementaries Squared (Addon)
- Soap in-world behaviour
- Retexturing various blocks to fit TFC color palettes
- Flower box accepting TFC large flowers (only accepts regular large flowers)
- Make Flax work as an alternative to jute (maybe in different climate band to give it a purpose)

Observed TFC bugs
- TFC candles get broken by pistons, TFC colored candles do not
- TFC candles lastUpdateTick doesn't get reset when put out manually, leading to a "time remaining" Jade tooltip
